# Verification Service API

An API that provides a unified, standard interface to the data sources needed to verify community engagement for the purpose of evaluating Medicaid eligibility.

## About the Project

<!-- This should be a longer-form description of the project. It can include history, background, details, problem statements, links to design documents or other supporting materials, or any other information/context that a user or contributor might be interested in. -->

This project evolved out of the [IVaaS](https://github.com/DSACMS/iv-cbv-payroll "IVaaS repository") tool for consent based verification. As the need for more complex forms of validation developed, it became clear that providing a way for agencies to integrate directly with an API was becoming increasingly useful, particularly for ex parte renewals. The ultimate goals of this and related projects is to remove as much friction as possible between the applicant and receiving their benefits by reducing the burden placed on them to manually provide evidence of eligibility.
